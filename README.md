# ds-skill-assess
## Phase II technical assessment for data scientist candidates

This repository contains a short, notional example of SQL & R files designed to test your technical knowledge of basic data wrangling and version control.

### Ground Rules
* You will have 1 hour to clone the repo, create your own branch, and push your branch back to the remote repo.
* Please keep all work on your branch. Do not submit a pull request for main.
* The errors are simple; do not over-think them.
* Describe your approach in the ReadMe file's section below, as opposed to in-line comments.

### Instructions
1. Clone the repo
2. From `main`, create your own branch with `[your last name]/submission`
3. Correct errors in the SQL and R script as follows:
  * The SQL contains an error that will not generate correct output to be received by the R file. Please correct the SQL so that its output will match what the R file requires.
  * The R file contains a single series of steps that could be separated into more descriptive functions or otherwise condensed to improve readability and maintainability. Please re-factor the R code to reflect cleaner, more maintainable code without altering functionality. *Please feel free to add separate function script files if you think this would help.*
  * In the ReadMe file, modify the below section to explain your overall approach. Write as if speaking to a non-technical audience.

**NOTE**: When making corrections in the SQL or R file, please also consider formatting adjustments that more closely conform to generally accepted style guidance (e.g., indentation, vertical alignment, etc.).

**IMPORTANT: You should NOT need to create sample data and you do NOT need to compile your code to ensure it runs.** This is not a test of syntax, but of your ability to discover and streamline inefficiency in the data pipeline.

4. Commit your edits and push your branch back to the remote repo within 1 hour

*GOOD LUCK!*
  
## About My Submission: `Rebekah McNichol`
I was rather off my feet with this one. I had brushed up on Pandas and then saw it was R, and of course that was rustier. 
I am also less experienced with GitHub having mostly played with simple branching in terminals.
